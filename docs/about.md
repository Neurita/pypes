# neurita/pypes

This is a Python module for brain PET and multimodal MRI processing.

It contains specific pipelines to pre-process this type of images.

I've tested these on ~140 subjects with very good results.
Without modifying parameters, 95% of the images were correctly registered and processed.
Very few subjects needed manual editings such as neck removal or AC-PC reorientation.
