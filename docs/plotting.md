# Plotting (under construction)

We abuse of [`nilearn`](http://nilearn.github.io/) functions to create
plotting functions to be able to plot slices in a matrix pattern such as in:

These functions are used in some of our pipelines, however you can also
use them on your own. To do that, have a look at the functions in
`pypes.interfaces.nilearn.plot`.

**Example**:

```python
from pypes import plot_ortho_slices

## ICA

The rs-fMRI pipeline includes a plotting step where independent components will
be plotted as in
